# tlbasic
TLBasic is an implementation of BASIC programming lanuage. It implements a simple complier and runtime environment for the Basic programming language. The complier translates the Basic programs into bytecode files, and the runtime environment executes the bytecode files. This project was written by pure C when I was a undergraduate student. It was just for fun. All source codes can be downloaded here.
